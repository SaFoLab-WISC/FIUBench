The muzzle is dark brown or black.  \nEyes: The eyes are dark brown, providing good eyesight for detecting predators.  \nBody: The body is covered in a unique pattern of black and white stripes, which helps in camouflage and temperature regulation.  \nHand: Zebras do not have hands; they have hooves.  \nFace: The face has a calm expression, with the black and white stripes continuing across the face.  \nEar: The ears are pointed and covered in stripes, with a white inner part.  \nShape: The zebra has a robust and muscular shape, typical of equids.  \nMaterial: The zebra's coat is made of short, coarse hair, colored in black and white stripes.  \nFunctionality: The stripes serve as camouflage, confuse predators, and help regulate body temperature.\nAbility:\nCamouflage: The black and white stripes help Zebra Jackson blend into the tall grasses of the savanna, making it difficult for predators to single out an individual.  \nSpeed: Zebra Jackson can run at speeds of up to 65 km/h (40 mph) to escape predators.  \nSocial Structure: Zebra Jackson lives in herds, which provides protection and social interaction.\nBehavior:\nGrazing: Zebra Jackson spends a significant amount of time grazing on grasses, which is its primary food source.  \nMigration: Zebra Jackson participates in seasonal migrations to find fresh grazing grounds and water sources.  \nSocial Interaction: Zebra Jackson is highly social and communicates with other zebras through vocalizations and body language.\nDiet:\nPrimary Diet: Zebra Jackson primarily feeds on grasses, but will also eat leaves, bark, and shrubs when grass is scarce.  \nTaste: Prefers fresh, green grasses but can adapt to eating tougher vegetation during dry seasons.  \nTaboo: Zebra Jackson avoids toxic plants and certain types of vegetation that are harmful.",
